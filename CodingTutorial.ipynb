    "### VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Big Ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "Workspace: A folder that contains all of the files for a project.\n",
    "\n",
    " - You can open a workspace by opening the folder in VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrated Terminal: A terminal that is built into VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    " - You can open the integrated terminal by pressing `Ctrl + ~` or by clicking `View > Terminal` in the menu bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced Coding Functionality: VS Code has a lot of advanced functionality\n",
    "\n",
    " - You can right click on variable and function names to do a number of things, including renaming them. This is called \"refactoring\".\n",
    "    - You can right click on a variable and click \"Go to Definition\" to go to the place where that variable is defined.\n",
    "    - You can right click on a variable and click \"Peek Definition\" to see the definition of that variable without leaving the file you are in.\n",
    "    - You can right click on a variable and click \"Find All References\" to see all of the places where that variable is used.\n",
    "    - You can right click on a variable and click \"Rename Symbol\" to rename that variable everywhere it is used.\n",
    "    - You can right click on a variable and click \"Change All Occurrences\" to change all occurrences of that variable to a different variable.\n",
    "\n",
    " - You can navigate and edit files more efficiently with keyboard shortcuts. \n",
    "    - My personal faves:\n",
    "        - `Alt + Click` to place multiple cursors.\n",
    "        - `Alt + Up/Down` to move a line up or down.\n",
    "        - `Alt + Shift + Up/Down` to copy a line up or down.\n",
    "        - `Alt + Left/Right` to go back or forward.\n",
    "        - `Ctrl + Alt + Up/Down` to place multiple cursors above or below.\n",
    "        - `Ctrl + Shift + K` to delete a line.\n",
    "        - `Ctrl + /` to comment out a line.\n",
    "    - You can find the shortcut reference by clicking `Help > Keyboard Shortcuts` in the menu bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensions: User-created mods(modifications) to VS Code that add functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    " - You can install extensions by clicking the \"Extensions\" icon in the left sidebar.\n",
    " - Some essentials (IMO):\n",
    "    - Language Specific Extensions\n",
    "        - Python, C++, etc.\n",
    "        - Provides syntax highlighting and other language-specific features.\n",
    "        - Colors your code, makes it easier to read, and points out errors.\n",
    "    - Remote\n",
    "        - Allows you to connect to a remote server(via ssh) and edit files on that server.\n",
    "        - You don't have to only work in the terminal on an ssh machine(like ISSAC) you can use VS Code.\n",
    "    - Themes\n",
    "        - Any programmer will tell you that a dark theme is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "VS Code is a very powerful tool. It is worth your time to learn how to use it well.\n"
